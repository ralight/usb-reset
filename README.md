usb-reset
=========

This is usb-reset, which allows you to easily perform a bus reset on a USB
device using its vendor and product ID.

If the device has got confused, this may sort it out.


Usage
=====

Reset a single device:

    sudo usb-reset 0328:6f51

Reset all USB devices in one go, for even easier operation:

	sudo usb-reset -a

This option does not reset USB hubs (to avoid interfering with internal hubs),
if you need to reset a hub you should specify the vendor and product ID as
above.


Installing
==========

The latest source can be found at:

It only depends on libusb 1.0 and should compile anywhere libusb is supported.

-- For instance, on Ubuntu install libusb with: 'sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0'

-- Compile with: 'gcc usb-reset.c -lusb-1.0 -o usb-reset'

-- Copy the binary to your local executable path: 'sudo cp usb-reset /usr/local/bin'


On systems where snaps are supported, usb-reset can be installed from the
Ubuntu Store. On Ubuntu 15.10 and earlier, or on other systems, you may need to
install snapd first.

History
=======

usb-reset was inspired by the Ubuntu Podcast episode S10E20 where a piece of
code was described that did the same thing but based on usb bus and device
numbers, which sounded like a pain. Getting the snap working took longer than
writing the code.
